                                    express their feelings and needs openly and without fear. Each person should feel
                                    like they have been heard and respected. Both parties should be able to walk away
                                    feeling like they have closure. A healthy break up is one where both parties are on
                                    the same page. They understand why the relationship is ending and they are okay with
                                    it. There is no need for either party to try to convince the other to stay in the
                                    relationship. A healthy break up is one where both parties are able to move on. They
                                    don't hold onto any resentment or bitterness. They are able to wish each other well
                                    and move forward with their lives.</p>
                                <h2 id="Subheading_1">Will no contact work if he lost feelings?</h2>
                                <p id="Paragraph_For_Subheading_1">

                                    There's no surefire answer to this question, as every situation is different. If
                                    your ex lost feelings for you and you are hoping that no contact will change his
                                    mind, it's possible that it could work. However, there's no guarantee that it will.
                                    No contact is a strategy that's often used in an effort to get an ex back, but it
                                    can also be used as a way to move on from a relationship. If your ex lost feelings
                                    for you and you are not sure what to do, the best thing to do is take some time for
                                    yourself. Focus on your own happiness and healing. Don't try to force anything or
                                    make any decisions about the future just yet. Give yourself some time and space to
                                    figure out what you want and what's best for you. No contact can be a difficult
                                    process, but if you give yourself the time and space you need, it can be very
                                    beneficial.</p>
                                <h2 id="Subheading_2">Does space help a broken relationship?</h2>
                                <p id="Paragraph_For_Subheading_2">

                                    There's no one answer to this question, as it depends on the situation. If both
                                    partners are willing to work on the relationship, then space can definitely help. It
                                    can give each person time to reflect on what they want and need from the
                                    relationship. It can also give them time to miss each other and appreciate all the
                                    good things about the relationship. However, if one or both partners are not willing
                                    to work on the relationship, then space is not going to help. In fact, it might make
                                    things worse. The partner who wants to work on the relationship will be left feeling
                                    frustrated and alone, while the partner who does not want to work on it will have
                                    all
                                    the space they need to pursue other interests. So ultimately, it depends on both
                                    partners' willingness to work on the relationship. If both partners are committed,
                                    then space can be a helpful tool. If not, then space is likely only going to make
                                    things worse.</p>
                                <h2 id="Subheading_3">Will he forget me if I don't contact him?</h2>
                                <p id="Paragraph_For_Subheading_3">

                                    If you don't contact him, he may forget you. This is especially true if you two only
                                    dated for a short time or if it's been awhile since you've seen each other. If
                                    you are worried about being forgotten, the best thing to do is to reach out and stay
                                    in touch. There are a lot of ways to do this, so find the method that works best for
                                    you. You can send him a text, give him a call, or even reach out on social media. If
                                    you are not sure what to say, start with a simple hello and see how he responds. If
                                    he is receptive, keep the conversation going. If he seems distant or uninterested,
                                    it
                                    might be best to back off and give him some space. The most important thing is to
                                    stay positive and keep an open mind. He may just need some time to remember how much
                                    he cares about you.</p>
                                <h2 id="Subheading_4">What are the 5 stages of break up?</h2>
                                <p id="Paragraph_For_Subheading_4">

                                    The five stages of break up are:

                                    1. Denial: This is the first stage of break up where you try to convince yourself
                                    that everything is fine and that the relationship is not over. You might even try to
                                    talk to your ex and convince them to give things another chance.

                                    2. Anger: This is the second stage of break up where you start to get angry at your
                                    ex for breaking up with you. You might even start to blame them for all the problems
                                    in the relationship.

                                    3. Bargaining: This is the third stage of break up where you start to bargain with
                                    your ex in an attempt to get them back. You might promise to change or do anything
                                    they want if they just take you back.

                                    4. Depression: This is the fourth stage of break up where you start to feel
                                    depressed about the situation. You might feel like you will never find someone else
                                    or that things will never be the same again.

                                    5. Acceptance: This is the fifth and final stage of break up where you accept that
                                    things are over and move on with your life. You might start dating again or focus on
                                    other aspects of your life such as friends, family, or hobbies</p>
